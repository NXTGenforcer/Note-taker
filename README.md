# Welcome to the Note taker!

## This application was a test of my express knowledge and usage abilities.

### You will be able to create, save, edit, and delete notes with this Heroku deployed application.

My biggest struggle with this project was understanding how to pass the data around successfully so the user data for the json text files was understood and recreated in json form.
